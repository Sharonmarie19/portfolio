<div class="about_me">
    <p>It was never a dream of mine to become a designer.  At least not visually, anyway.  Yes.  I wanted to design, but I wanted to use my words, a pen and paper.  I wanted to design a world that people could imagine and get lost in.  A world that would make people be feel better and be better.  But fate is funny.  Today, I am a designer.  I only design in a different way but for the same reason.  Now I design visuals and experiences that can help people be better and do better.  Now, I design with colors and shapes.</p>
