<h1 class=label>Who I Am</h1>
<p class="me">I never thought I would be here.  I always thought this would be hard.  I started life wanting to write books and movies about love and romance.  I wanted to design the perfect world filled with endless possibilities for happiness and success using my words.  After years of trying to figure how to make that happen, here I am creating a world of happiness and success using shapes, colors and code.</p>
