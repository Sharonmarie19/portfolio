    <h1>My Work</h1>
    <p>My background in Crisis Managemnet has allowed me the opportunity to focus my designs on prevention, repairing, and celebrating.  I like to consider myself a designer of real things for real people.  My work allows me to create spaces and opportunoities for people to actually live their lives with as little worry as possible. <br> My designs are simple, easy to navigate, and fun to use.  They focus on user needs and are based on remedies for user painpoints.</p>

    <h1>Budget Break</h1>
    <p>This app was born from a class project.  Our class was given a list of prompts to choose from.  This prompt hit close to home.  "Create a budgeting app for single parents."  I must admit, I chose this one because I am a single parent and I just knew that my experiences would make the process easy and fun.  <br> I was right about one thing.  The process was fun, but it wasn't easy.  </p>

    <h1>Discovery</h1>
    <p>At the start, I thought about who my audience was.  I conducted interviews with qualitative and quantitative questions about the user's budgeting practices.  Do they budget? Why or why not?  If you do, what tools do you use?  With the answers I received, I was able to learn about painpoints, tools used and the reason they have for creating that budget.  I was able to take these interviews and turn them into How Might We questions.</p>

    <h1>Personas</h1>
    <p>Using my interviews, I was able to come up with 3 personas.  These are my main users.</p>

    <h1>Sketches and Wireframes</h1>
    <p>After I learned more about my users, I decided on a name.  I thought of the user's time and desired effort for the act of budgeting.  I thought let's make it something quick and easy. Something the user can do while on their break.  The title <em>Budget Break</em> was born.  <br> I started out with big ideas for how I wanted to create continuity through out the app.  How can I connect the title with the look?  I considered a coffee break.  I drew doughnuts and sugar cubes.  Coffee cups that overflowed once a goal was reached, and even colorful sprinkles to celebrate that accomplichment.  Then I thought how are those things going to help my users budget and save?  I changed course and decided not to be so literal.  I considered my title and what it means.  Breaks at work are at least 15 minutes long.  How can my design help put those 15 minutes to good use?  So I developed a simpler design.</p>
