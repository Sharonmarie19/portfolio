      <h1>Budget Break</h1>
      <p>
        This app was born from a class project. Our class was given a list of
        prompts to choose from. This prompt hit close to home. "Create a
        budgeting app for single parents." I must admit, I chose this one
        because I am a single parent and I just knew that my experiences would
        make the process easy and fun. <br />
        I was right about one thing. The process was fun, but it wasn't easy.

      <h1>Discovery</h1>
      <p>
        At the start, I thought about who my audience was. I conducted
        interviews with qualitative and quantitative questions about the user's
        budgeting practices. Do they budget? Why or why not? If you do, what
        tools do you use? With the answers I received, I was able to learn about
        painpoints, tools used and the reason they have for creating that
        budget. I was able to take these interviews and turn them into How Might
        We questions.

      <h1>Personas</h1>
      <p>
        Using my interviews, I was able to come up with 3 personas. These are my
        main users.

      <h1>Sketches and Wireframes</h1>
      <p>
        After I learned more about my users, I decided on a name. I thought of
        the user's time and desired effort for the act of budgeting. I thought
        let's make it something quick and easy. Something the user can do while
        on their break. The title <em>Budget Break</em> was born. <br />
        I started out with big ideas for how I wanted to create continuity
        through out the app. How can I connect the title with the look? I
        considered a coffee break. I drew doughnuts and sugar cubes. Coffee cups
        that overflowed once a goal was reached, and even colorful sprinkles to
        celebrate that accomplichment. Then I thought how are those things going
        to help my users budget and save? I changed course and decided not to be
        so literal. I considered my title and what it means. Breaks at work are
        at least 15 minutes long. How can my design help put those 15 minutes to
        good use? So I developed a simpler design.
