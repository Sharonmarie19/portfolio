 <h1>Sharon Walters</h1>
 <h2>UX Designer</h2>
    <p>I am an enthusiastic UX/UI graduate from Kenzie Academy looking to take the Public Relations and Crisis Management skills I have learned, in both theory and practice, into the Tech world as a UX designer. I pride myself on getting back from the Universe what I put into it. I live by the rule of "Treat people the way they want to be treated." Creating a world where empathy is not the exception but the rule. </p>
    <h1>My Work</h1>
    <p>
      My background in Crisis Managemnet has allowed me the opportunity to focus
      my designs on prevention, repairing, and celebrating. I like to consider
      myself a designer of real things for real people. My work allows me to
      create spaces and opportunoities for people to actually live their lives
      with as little worry as possible. <br />
      My designs are simple, easy to navigate, and fun to use. They focus on
      user needs and are based on remedies for user painpoints.
    </p>
